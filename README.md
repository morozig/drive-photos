## Why?
This website was created due to [Google's storage policy change of June 1, 2021](https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/).
The author *might* have saved a lot of comics as images in Google Drive while it provided unlimited free storage for high quality photos.
[Standard web client](https://drive.google.com/) is not very suitable to view sequences of images because of lack of preloading and single zoom setting.
So the only option is to install [Drive for desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) and
a nice comics reader like [Mcomix](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcomix/).
This works great but not mobile friendly.
[Drivephotos.co](https://drivephotos.co) is an online image viewer for Google Drive accessible via browser from multiple devices
