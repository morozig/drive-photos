      <h2>
        Why?
      </h2>
      <p>
        This website was created due to
        <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/">
          Google's storage policy change of June 1, 2021
        </a>.
        The author <i>might</i> have saved a lot of comics as images in Google Drive
        while it provided unlimited free storage for high quality photos.
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Standard web client</a>
        is not very suitable to view sequences of images
        because of lack of preloading and single zoom setting.
        So the only option is to install
        <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Drive for desktop</a>
        and a nice comics reader like 
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcomix/">Mcomix</a>.
        This works great but not mobile friendly.
        <a href="/">Drivephotos.co</a> is an online image viewer
        for Google Drive accessible via browser from multiple devices

        How to read CBR and CBZ files?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/">Drive Photos</a> was not designed to work with these file types or
        other archives for simplicity and performance
        (browsers are good at rendering images, not extracting huge zip files).
        There are apps for that:
      </p>
      <uL>
        <li>On desktop use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcomix/">Mcomix</a></li>
        <li>On Android use <a href="https://tachiyomi.org/">Tachiyomi</a></li>
        <li>On iOS use <a href="https://www.yacreader.com/">YACReader</a></li>
      </uL>
      <p>
        But if you want to read CBR and CBZ files across platforms for free
        you could easily extract pictures from those archives with RAR or Zip respectively
        and save to your Google Drive, then open them in <a href="/view">Drive Photos</a> from anywhere.

      <h2>
        How to start a slideshow from a folder in Google Drive?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are several ways to achieve that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can install and launch <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Drive for desktop</a>.
          It will mount a new drive in your system. Then you can open this folder in any image viewer
          and start a slideshow
        </li>
        <li>
          You can open <a href="https://www.google.com/photos">Google Photos</a>, press Upload photos,
          select Google Drive, choose your folder.
          Then create a gallery from newly added photos and start a slideshow there
        </li>
        <li>
          Or simply open your folder in <a href="/view">Drive Photos</a> and press play.
          You may also switch to fullscreen for a better experience
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="googlephotos">
      <h2>
        Comparison with Google Photos
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://photos.google.com/">Google Photos</a> is a great app and it is very suitable to access
        your own photos and memories ordered by time. However it's not easy to manage your collection as simple files.
        If you ever wondered how to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create nested albums
        </li>
        <li>
          Order files in album by filename
        </li>
        <li>
          Find files that occupy storage space and are less than 5 MB
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        you may have found that all of these things are currently impossible in Google Photos.
        That's why some users prefer to store photos in Google Drive instead.
        And now you can view your images in a more convenient way.
